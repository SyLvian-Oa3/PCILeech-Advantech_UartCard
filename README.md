## PCILeech-Advantech_UartCard
A “senior FPGA engineer” form China, has been hawking a slapped-together custom firmware for ¥1200 (about $200) a pop, After hearing about it from a friend in CN, I’m opensourcing this project to stop more folks from getting scammed

And now it’s public, transparent, and free

Oh, and before anyone gets clever: a bunch of AC systems already flag this stuff

## 0x0 Why?
If someone’s trying to sell you this exact “solution,” you can point them here and save your wallet, **No black-box BS.** YOU GET SRC NOW

## 0x1 Status
Marked/flagged by multiple anti-cheat engines in the wild, Assume nothing is hidden

## 0x2 Build & usage
you can build it urself
But this repo intentionally doesn’t spoon-feed a step-by-step “press here to cheat” guide 

If you can’t figure out basic toolchains, constraints, and flashing procedures, you probably should STOP

**Common sense > copy-paste**

## 0x3 So
If someone tries to charge you $200 for this exact setup, send them this link and keep your cash cash

Thanks to the friend who surfaced the scam—y’all know who you are
